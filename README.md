Open Source Temperature Conversion Tool

Welcome!  

PLEASE NOTE:  There are currently two parallel versions of this project.  The "BasicCrickulator.py" is a simple procedural program.  If you're new to open source and here to explore basic programming in a team environment, "BasicCrickulator.py" is probably a good fit.  The "Thermometer.py" is an object-oriented project with contributions from programmers with more Python experience.  If that's what you're looking for, check it out.

This project is to design a helpful tool to convert between temperature systems, including temperature measured by cricket chirps.  The current plan is for all data to be entered manually by the user.  However, if you're interested in mobile development and hardware implementation, feel free to create an app that can count chirps automatically.

You can check the Procedure section in [this article](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/bring-science-home-cricket-temperature/) for additional insight.

Thanks to my awesome wife Tiffany McCann who first told me about the crickets and suggested I build the program.
