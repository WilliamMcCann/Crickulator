# Crickulator
Open Source Temperature Conversion Tool

This project is to design a helpful tool to convert between temperature systems, including temperature measured by cricket chirps.  The current plan is for all data to be entered manually by the user.  However, if you're interested in mobile development and hardware implementation, feel free to create an app that can count chirps automatically.
